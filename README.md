This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

Then add a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following variable:
```bash
API_HOME=http://localhost:3000/api/
```
The port can be changed if you need to add a different one. It must be the same one as your project.

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
